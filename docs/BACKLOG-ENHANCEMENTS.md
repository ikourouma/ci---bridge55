# Bridge55 Backlog — Explore & Destinations Enhancements (Future)

This backlog captures **recommended (optional) enhancements** to reach Fortune‑100 booking platform maturity.  
These are intentionally separated from Phase‑1/2 delivery to keep execution fast and stable.

## P0 (Next sprint / highest ROI)
- **Data migration to JSON**: move in-page demo datasets to `data/` (see `docs/EXPLORE-DATA-MODEL.md`).
- **Shared filter component**: unify chip/dropdown/search patterns between Explore + Destinations.
- **Sponsored card rules**: consistent labeling (`Sponsored`) + placement rules + targeting (country/region/category).
- **SEO expansion**: destination deep links + Things-to-do category landing pages + breadcrumb schema per mode.

## P1 (Strong differentiators)
- **Map toggle** for Top Destinations (desktop): list ↔ map view.
- **Personalization**: trending picks based on behavior (recent searches, region affinity).
- **Inventory signals**: add “Free cancellation”, “Pay later”, “Verified partner”, “Visa-light” badges.
- **Deals module**: “Deals for {Country}” feed with strict relevance + sponsor governance.

## P2 (Scale + enterprise readiness)
- **White-label targeting**: domain-based default country/platform mode; per-tenant partner slots.
- **A/B testing hooks**: section ordering and monetization slot variants.
- **Analytics**: filter usage tracking + conversion funnels for Destinations/Explore.
- **Localization**: country-aware copy variants and language packs for Destinations/Things to do.

## Notes
- Contract stays non-negotiable: **country theming (colors + icon accents) must apply everywhere** and unknown countries must fall back to **Pan‑African**.
