# FlowMode v5.4 — Country-Specific Only (Bridge55)
# Owner: Afronovation, Inc.
# Scope: This governance applies ONLY to /country-specific

## Purpose
Attach Afronovation's FlowMode v5.4 to ensure safe, high-quality delivery using AI-assisted development.

## Non-Negotiables

### 1) Every Response Must Start With:
- Blast Radius: (0–5)
- Tier: (1/2/3)
- Change Manager Required: (Yes/No)

### 2) Output Format (Always):
- PLAN (max 6 bullets)
- PATCH (only the exact files + exact edits)
- VERIFY (commands + what to check)
- ROLLBACK (how to revert safely)

## Scope Discipline
- Do ONLY the requested change. No drive-by refactors.
- If you see unrelated issues, log a TODO comment only.

## Risk Rules
- Routing changes (utils/routing.js): Blast Radius >= 3 by default
- Shared utilities (any file in /utils used across pages): Blast Radius 3 by default
- Data boundary changes (Supabase schema, RLS, auth/session, user roles): Blast Radius >= 4 and Tier 3
- Payment/booking money movement (future): Blast Radius 5 and Tier 3

## Safety
- Never propose destructive commands (rm -rf, force push) without Tier-3 approval
- Never output or request hardcoded secrets
- Never weaken RLS
- Never store service role keys in client code

## SaaS UX Integrity
- No placeholder UI
- Every page must handle: loading, empty, error
- Every card must be clickable or removed
- Navigation must never dead-end

## Uncertainty Rule
- If uncertain, ask for the smallest missing input instead of guessing
