## 🎬 **4-MINUTE INVESTOR DEMO SCRIPT**

### **Slide 1: Introduction** (30 sec)
"Bridge55 is Africa's first federated travel platform. Think Stripe for travel—we enable any African business to offer world-class travel services under their own brand. Today, I'll show you our flagship service: flight booking."

### **Slide 2: Search Hub** (30 sec)
[Open `bridge55-search-hub-FINAL.html`]

"Our search hub is the entry point for 6 services. Notice the Kenya branding—the platform auto-detects the user's country and applies local colors. Each country in our federation gets their own branded experience. For flights, users fill in their trip details and hit search."

[Click Search → Navigate to results]

### **Slide 3: Search Results** (30 sec)
[On `search-results-list-ENHANCED.html`]

"Results are powered by intelligent filtering. Users can filter by price, airlines, number of stops, and departure time. We highlight African airlines like Kenya Airways, South African Airways, and Rwanda Air. The interface supports both list and grid views for user preference."

[Show filters, toggle to grid view briefly, return to list]  
[Click "View Details" on first flight]

### **Slide 4: Flight Details** (30 sec)
[On `flight-details.html`]

"Every flight has comprehensive details: visual timeline, pricing breakdown, baggage allowance. Notice the airline contact information—it's dynamically localized. A traveler in Nairobi sees Kenya Airways' Nairobi contact, while someone in Lagos sees the Lagos office. This is the kind of African-specific intelligence built into every part of our platform."

[Scroll to show FAQs, airline contacts]  
[Click "Book This Flight"]

### **Slide 5: Booking Form** (45 sec)
[On `booking-PRODUCTION.html`]

"Our booking form is IATA-compliant with smart automation. When users enter a birth date, the system auto-calculates if they're an infant, child, or adult—and adjusts pricing accordingly. It validates passports with 6-month expiry rules, auto-detects if a traveler needs an eVisa based on their nationality and destination, and offers to handle it right here."

[Fill in passenger details quickly]

"Users select seats on an interactive seat map, add extras like baggage or meals, and the price updates in real-time."

[Select a seat, show price update]  
[Click "Continue to Payment"]

### **Slide 6: Payment** (45 sec)
[On `payment-PHASE2-COMPLETE.html`]

"Here's where Bridge55 truly shines for Africa. We support Bridge Wallet—our proprietary digital wallet with virtual Visa cards—plus ALL major African mobile money operators: M-Pesa, MTN Money, Airtel Money, Orange Money. Of course, we also support international cards and bank transfers."

"Payment priority is country-smart: Kenyan users see M-Pesa first, Ghanaians see MTN Mobile Money first. Security is paramount—every transaction requires multi-factor authentication."

[Select Bridge Wallet]  
[Click "Pay with Bridge Wallet"]  
[Show MFA modal, enter OTP: 123456]  
[Click "Verify & Confirm Payment"]

### **Slide 7: Confirmation** (30 sec)
[On `confirmation.html`]

"Success! Users receive an airline-standard e-ticket with a compact boarding pass. They can add it to Apple Wallet or Google Pay for real-time flight updates on their lock screen. Download a PDF for printing, add to their calendar, or email it to themselves."

[Scroll to show boarding pass]  
[Click "Add to Apple Wallet" → Show demo alert]

"The boarding pass uses Kenya Airways branding with the QR code for airport check-in. This is the same quality you'd get booking directly with the airline."

### **Slide 8: Closing** (15 sec)
"This is ONE of our six services, and it's already production-ready. We're building the same quality for stays, cars, experiences, eVisas, and AI trip planning. Bridge55 isn't just another OTA—we're building the infrastructure for African travel."

**Total**: 4 minutes 15 seconds
