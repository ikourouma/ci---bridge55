Below is a **clear, execution-ready instruction** for implementing **CI/CD enforcement** that aligns *perfectly* with your just-finalized **BRIDGE55 PLATFORM EXECUTION INSTRUCTION**.
This is written so you can give it directly to Cursor **or** a DevOps engineer.

---

# 🚀 CI/CD IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTION

## Bridge55 Tourism Platform (Demo → Live, Fortune-100 Standard)

**Purpose:**
Ensure that *no code* can be merged, deployed, or demoed unless it **fully complies** with the execution rules you defined.

This CI/CD system is **not optional** and **not advisory**.
It is an automated gatekeeper.

---

## 1. CI/CD PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **The pipeline enforces product integrity, not just code quality.**

This means CI/CD must validate:

* Navigation correctness
* Data completeness
* Demo integrity
* UX invariants (breadcrumb, header, footer)
* Card → details relationships
* Operator approval rules
* Schema validity

If *any* rule fails → **deployment is blocked**.

---

## 2. PIPELINE STAGES (REQUIRED)

Your CI/CD pipeline must have **exactly these stages**, in this order:

```
1. Install & Build
2. Schema Validation
3. Demo Integrity Audit
4. Navigation & Routing Audit
5. UI Contract Audit
6. Mode Compliance Check
7. Final Gate (PASS / FAIL)
```

No stage may be skipped.

---

## 3. STAGE 1 — Install & Build

### Objective

Ensure the project builds cleanly before validation.

### Requirements

* Install dependencies
* Build static assets
* Fail on build warnings treated as errors

Example (conceptual):

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

---

## 4. STAGE 2 — Schema Validation (CRITICAL)

### Objective

Ensure **every rendered entity** conforms to its schema.

### Required Schemas

You must define JSON schemas for:

* Operator
* Company
* Region
* Interest
* Experience
* Itinerary

### Enforcement Rule

```text
If an entity is rendered on any page
AND its schema is invalid
→ FAIL THE PIPELINE
```

This prevents:

* Partial demo data
* Broken operator profiles
* Silent “Loading…” states

---

## 5. STAGE 3 — Demo Integrity Audit (MANDATORY)

### Objective

Guarantee **demo completeness**.

### Audit Script (Required)

CI must run:

```bash
node audit-demo.js
```

### audit-demo.js MUST verify:

#### Data completeness

* Every card has a valid `id`
* Every `id` exists in demo data
* Every demo entity has:

  * title
  * description
  * image(s)
  * linked relationships

#### Forbidden states in demo mode

* “Not Found”
* “Loading…”
* Empty sections
* Placeholder copy
* Broken images

If any appear → **FAIL**

---

## 6. STAGE 4 — Navigation & Routing Audit

### Objective

Ensure **natural, deterministic navigation**.

### Checks

* Every `<a href="...details.html?id=...">`

  * resolves to an existing demo entity
* No card links to:

  * generic pages
  * reused detail pages
* No `?name=` routing
* Breadcrumb path matches actual hierarchy

Example failure:

> Card → Operator Details → “Operator Not Found”

➡️ **FAIL**

---

## 7. STAGE 5 — UI Contract Audit (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Objective

Guarantee UX consistency across the entire platform.

### Each page must pass:

* Exactly **1 global header**
* Exactly **1 global footer**
* Breadcrumb exists and is visible
* Mega menu initialized
* Hamburger menu functional

If:

* Breadcrumb missing
* Footer duplicated
* Header overridden locally

➡️ **FAIL**

---

## 8. STAGE 6 — Mode Compliance Check (DEMO vs LIVE)

### Objective

Ensure platform behavior matches execution mode.

### Rules

If `BRIDGE55_MODE === "demo"`:

* ❌ Empty profiles forbidden
* ❌ Incomplete operators forbidden
* ❌ Cards without details forbidden
* ✅ Demo reviews allowed
* ✅ Demo-only operators allowed

If `BRIDGE55_MODE === "live"`:

* ❌ Demo data forbidden
* ❌ Fake reviews forbidden
* ❌ Unapproved operators forbidden

Mismatch → **FAIL**

---

## 9. STAGE 7 — FINAL GATE

### Output Rules

* If **any stage fails**:

  * Deployment blocked
  * Clear error message printed
* Only if **all stages pass**:

  * Allow merge
  * Allow deploy
  * Allow demo

This is your **Fortune-100 quality gate**.

---

## 10. ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)

### Domains

| Domain                 | Mode |
| ---------------------- | ---- |
| `ivoire.bridge55.co`   | demo |
| `*.bridge55.co` (prod) | live |

CI must **assert** correct mode per domain.

---

## 11. WHY THIS HELPS THE ENTIRE PROJECT (STRATEGIC VIEW)

This CI/CD system ensures:

### ✅ No regression during fast iteration

### ✅ No embarrassing demo failures

### ✅ No broken navigation ever reaches stakeholders

### ✅ Demo data stays coherent across pages

### ✅ Teams can move fast *without fear*

### ✅ Live launch becomes a config switch, not a rewrite

This is exactly how large-scale SaaS platforms operate.

---

## 12. WHAT WE DO NEXT (AFTER CI/CD IS RUNNING)

Once this CI/CD pipeline is active, we can safely and calmly work on:

1. Designing the Côte d’Ivoire demo data schema (formalized)
2. Defining exact admin UI screens
3. Drafting approval-state UX flows
4. Creating the demo/live switch UX spec
5. Preparing a tourism-board demo walkthrough script

You’re now operating at **platform-architect level**, not “page fixing.”
