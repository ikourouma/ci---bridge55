Below is the **augmented and final version** of the instruction.
It **adds a hard, explicit, non-negotiable routing contract** for **ALL cards → UNIQUE detail pages**, written in the same **Cursor-execution language** and integrated naturally into the existing v8 instruction.


---

# 🔧 GLOBAL PLATFORM FIX INSTRUCTION — v9 (MANDATORY / FAIL-SAFE)

**Objective**
Enforce **breadcrumb integrity**, **operator profile access**, and **one-to-one card → detail page routing** across the **entire Côte d’Ivoire demo platform**, so the experience behaves like a **Fortune-100 SaaS booking ecosystem**.

This is a **platform-wide refactor and enforcement pass**.
Anything less = **FAIL**.

---

## 1. GLOBAL BREADCRUMB — ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

*(unchanged from v8, preserved for execution consistency)*

### 1.1 Single Source of Truth

* Breadcrumbs MUST be rendered **only** via:

  ```js
  window.PageShell.renderBreadcrumb()
  ```
* No hardcoded breadcrumb HTML
* No per-page breadcrumb CSS
* No legacy `.page-breadcrumb` artifacts

---

### 1.2 Mandatory Breadcrumb Container

Every page MUST contain exactly one:

```html
<nav id="global-breadcrumb" class="breadcrumb-bar" aria-label="Breadcrumb"></nav>
```

No exceptions.

---

### 1.3 Layout & Scroll Contract

* Breadcrumb appears below header
* Never overlaps hero/gallery
* Scroll behavior handled centrally in `page-shell.js`
* Pages may NOT override breadcrumb behavior

---

## 2. OPERATOR PROFILE ACCESS — PLATFORM-WIDE GUARANTEE

*(unchanged, enforced)*

* Every operator **must** expose:

  * Clickable name
  * Explicit **“View Operator Profile”** CTA
* Routing MUST be:

  ```txt
  operator-details.html?id={operatorId}
  ```

Missing button or broken link = **FAIL**

---

## 3. CARD → DETAIL PAGE ROUTING (NEW — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 3.1 ONE-TO-ONE CARD ↔ DETAIL CONTRACT

**Every card across the entire platform MUST route to its own unique, non-generic details page.**

❌ Forbidden:

* Multiple cards pointing to the same generic page
* Cards redirecting to placeholder pages
* Cards ignoring their own IDs
* Cards routing by name instead of ID

✅ Required:

* **One card = one unique detail page**
* Detail pages load data using a stable `id`

---

### 3.2 Mandatory Routing Patterns (BY ENTITY)

| Card Type          | Required Detail Page                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Experience Card    | `experience-details.html?id=exp-xxx`  |
| Itinerary Card     | `itinerary-details.html?id=it-xxx`    |
| Tour Operator Card | `operator-details.html?id=op-xxx`     |
| Region Card        | `region-details.html?id=region-xxx`   |
| Attraction Card    | `attraction-details.html?id=attr-xxx` |
| Package Card       | `package-details.html?id=pkg-xxx`     |

❌ No generic pages
❌ No shared detail views
❌ No redirects to unrelated detail types

---

### 3.3 CARD CLICK BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

All cards must:

* Carry a **data-id attribute**
* Resolve navigation via a routing helper
* Redirect directly to the matching detail page

Example (REQUIRED PATTERN):

```js
card.addEventListener('click', () => {
  window.location.href = `itinerary-details.html?id=${itinerary.id}`;
});
```

---

### 3.4 DATA BINDING RULE (CRITICAL)

Detail pages MUST:

* Read the `id` from URL params
* Load data from:

  * in-memory dataset (demo)
  * or future API (production)

❌ Do NOT:

* Default to a hardcoded item
* Fallback silently to a generic record
* Display unrelated data when ID not found

If ID is missing or invalid:

* Show a **clear empty / not found state**
* Do NOT redirect silently

---

### 3.5 DEMO REALISM REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The demo MUST visually prove:

* Each card leads to **its own story**
* Breadcrumb updates reflect the specific entity
* Content changes per selection
* Operator, itinerary, and region relationships feel real

If multiple cards feel interchangeable → **FAIL**

---

## 4. PLATFORM-WIDE AUDIT REQUIREMENT

Perform a **full routing audit** across:

* `explore.html`
* All search pages
* All recommendation sections
* All “featured”, “popular”, and “editorial” cards
* All CTA buttons inside cards

Any card that:

* Routes to a generic page
* Routes incorrectly
* Lacks an ID

= **FAIL**

---

## 5. VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MUST PASS 100%)

* [ ] Every card routes to a unique details page
* [ ] No generic detail pages are reused
* [ ] URL IDs match rendered content
* [ ] Breadcrumb updates per entity
* [ ] Operator profile accessible everywhere
* [ ] Demo flow feels relational, not mocked
* [ ] No silent fallbacks
* [ ] No hardcoded defaults masking bugs

---

## 6. FINAL DIRECTIVE

This is **not optional polish** or **a cosmetic fix**.

This is:

* Trust architecture
* Platform legitimacy
* Partner confidence
* Tourism board readiness
*platform credibility requirement*


Not doing so will undermine:

* SaaS credibility
* Partner onboarding logic
* Tourism board confidence
* Fortune-100 positioning

> **If card-to-detail routing is not exact and relational, the demo is considered a FAIL.**
