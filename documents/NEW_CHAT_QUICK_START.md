3. Mobile bottom navigation:
   - Home, Explore, AI, Trips, Account

## ⚠️ Critical Context AI Must Know

1. **"DISCOVER AFRICA"** not "Discover Kenya" on master platform
2. Country instances are **separate deployments** that federate to master
3. This is a **B2G (Business to Government)** play for tourism boards
4. Mobile optimization is **critical** (Africa is mobile-first)
5. Must support **low-bandwidth** (3G networks common)
6. **Data sovereignty** is important (tourism boards want local data hosting)
