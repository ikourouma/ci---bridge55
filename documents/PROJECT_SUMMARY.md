## 💡 Key Decisions Captured

### 1. Federated Architecture
**Decision**: Hub-and-spoke with country instances
**Why**: Data sovereignty, government partnerships, multiple revenue streams
**Impact**: Higher complexity but much higher value

### 2. First Country: Côte d'Ivoire
**Decision**: Launch bridge55.ci first
**Why**: West Africa representation, French market, strong tourism potential
**Impact**: Validates model, easier to scale after

### 3. Navigation Strategy
**Decision**: Adaptive navigation (Pan-African vs Country-Specific)
**Why**: One codebase, two experiences, optimized for each use case
**Impact**: "Discover Africa" vs "Discover Côte d'Ivoire"

### 4. Technology Stack
**Decision**: React + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind
**Why**: Modern, scalable, fast development, great developer experience
**Impact**: Can move quickly, easy to hire developers

### 5. Business Model
**Decision**: SaaS (white-label) + Marketplace (commissions)
**Why**: Multiple revenue streams, recurring revenue
**Impact**: $270k-810k/month potential from SaaS alone
