## 🧪 **QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue**: Page doesn't navigate after clicking Search
**Fix**: Open browser console (F12), check for JavaScript errors

### **Issue**: Booking form says "Fill required fields"
**Fix**: Ensure you filled all passenger 1 fields, selected a seat, and filled contact email/phone

### **Issue**: Payment modal doesn't appear
**Fix**: Make sure you clicked a payment method submit button (e.g., "Pay with Bridge Wallet")

### **Issue**: Country branding not showing
**Fix**: The default is Kenya (orange). To change, modify the `userCountry` variable in the search hub JavaScript
